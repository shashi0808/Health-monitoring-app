App Development Assignment: Soil Health Monitoring App
Objective
Develop a simple Android app using Flutter that connects via Bluetooth to a hand-held device,
retrieves temperature and moisture readings of soil, and stores them in Firebase. The app should
also provide a clean UI to display current and historical readings.
Note: Responses generated by ChatGPT will be rejected immediately.
Requirements
1. Bluetooth Device Communication
• The app should be able to scan and connect to a Bluetooth device (assume a
generic device emitting mock temperature + moisture readings).
• Capture the latest temperature (°C) and moisture (%) values.
• For applicants without hardware access, mock the data but structure it so that real
integration is straightforward.
2. Firebase Integration
• Store each reading in Firebase Firestore with:
o Timestamp
o Temperature value
o Moisture value
3. App UI (Flutter)
• Home Screen:
o Should have two distinct buttons marked as “Test” and “Reports”.
o The “Test” button should manually fetch a new reading.

o The “Reports” button should show the latest reading (temperature + moisture).
• History Screen:
o Show a list or graph of past readings retrieved from Firebase.
• Login/Signup:
o Simple authentication (Firebase Auth) using email/password.
4. Code Quality
• Use proper state management (Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc).
• Ensure the project has a README with setup instructions.
• Keep the design minimal, clean, and intuitive.
Deliverables
1. Flutter source code (GitHub or zip).
2. Working APK build.
3. Short README with:
a. Setup instructions.
b. Assumptions made (especially about Bluetooth).
Good to have
• Graphical charts for data visualization (e.g., line chart of moisture trends).
• Real-time sync updates from Firebase.
• Offline caching of last readings.
